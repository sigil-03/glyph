## interpreter
* can only parse one line in a file, might be something to do with using `nc`, dunno

## glyphic-client
* gotta write this, and then i can see if that fixes the `nc` issue above
* client should ask the glyph server for a list of glyphs that it has, which will then get used to generate the list of available commands
